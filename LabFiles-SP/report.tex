    Retrieving predicates for continents & 00:45 & 
        - Most continents had predicates for Area. \newline
        - Missing values for area was allowed, as I could not find a path to any other predicates which could represent area of continents.

    Retrieving predicates for countries & 01:25 & 
        - Countries did not use consistent predicates to respresent the same attribute. \newline
        - Further work was needed to get possible candidate values for some attributes. \newline
        - There were some missing values, in such instances a comprimise was made to either allow or fill-in a missing value.

    \hline
    Retrieving predicates for cities & 01:55 & 
        - Faced some problems in retrieving a province for the city. \newline
        - Some predicates were missing, e.g. population, latitude, longitude and elevation.

    \hline
    Retrieving predicates for provinces & 02:00 & 
        - Most of the time was taken to find a way to get a capital city for provinces, escpecially where such values were missing, I had to decide on the best way to impute a value.  \newline
        - Took time to handle missing values for population and area. \newline
        - Used existing filters from exploration to remove clerical/religious administrative regions.
    \\
    \hline
    Retrieving predicates for organizations & 01:45 & 
        - Difficulty in retrieving formation/established dates, there wasn't a consistent way that organizations represented these values.  \newline
        - Information about the headquarter city/country/province were difficult to retrieve, most of it were missing and I did not have enough time to find alternative predicates that represent this information.
    \\
    \hline
    Retrieving predicates for languages & 01:30 & 
        - Most of the time was spent on calculating the percentage of speakers. No langauges had a percentage of speakers, so it required a hacky way of calculating a percentage. \newline
        - Some languages did not have a property for the number of speakers. I did not have enough time to find other properties which may refer to the number of speakers.

\section{Continent}
\subsection{Exploration}
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
SELECT DISTINCT ?continent
WHERE {
    ?continent rdf:type dbo:Continent.
    ?continent rdfs:label ?continentN.
    FILTER(lang(?continentN) = "en")
    BIND(STR(?continentN) AS ?cName)
    FILTER(?cName in ("North America", "South America", "Oceania", "Asia", "Europe", "Africa"))
}
\end{verbatim}}

For the Continent concept, the goal of the exploration was to identify the continents present in DBpedia and confirm their relevance to the Mondial database.
\\ \\
Retrieving all continent entities of the class \texttt{dbo:Continent} showed that DBpedia classified sub-continents and continental regions as part
\texttt{dbo:Continent} ontology.
Moreover, DBpedia holds multiple continents with the same name as separate continents, e.g. Australasia, and Oceania. Another conflict
was that Mondial does not distinguish between North America or South America, rather, it's classified together as America. DBpedia did not present any results
where both North America and South America were classified together as a continent.
\\ \\
Due to these reasons, filters on the continent name were used to retrieve URIs of continents similar to those stored in the Mondial database.

\subsection{Retrieval}

{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
SELECT DISTINCT ?Name ?Area
WHERE {
    ?continent rdf:type dbo:Continent.
    ?continent rdfs:label ?continentN.
    FILTER(lang(?continentN) = "en")
    BIND(STR(?continentN) AS ?Name)
    FILTER(?Name in ("North America", "South America", "Oceania", "Asia", "Europe", "Africa"))
    OPTIONAL{?continent dbo:areaTotal ?AreaTotal}
    BIND(?AreaTotal / 1000000 AS ?Area) #Convert m^2 to km^2
}
\end{verbatim}}

The goal of the retrieval query was to build on top of the exploratory query to retrieve continent names and the area in squared kilometers, as seen in the Mondial database. From exploring the URI pages for all the
continents, it was found that Europe did not have a predicate for the toal area, all the other continent had a predicate: texttt{dbo:areaTotal}.
This demonstrates one of the challenges of working with schema-less graph databases, where properties are not uniformly applied across all instances of a particular type
(e.g., dbo:Continent). Such inconsistencies can limit the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the dataset.
To handle this limitation, the retrieval query uses the OPTIONAL keyword, ensuring that the absence of dbo:areaTotal for Europe does not cause the query to omit true continents.
\\ \\
The query is effective to an extent for retreiving continents relevant to Mondial. It's able to retrieve both the continent name and the total area (where available), using strict
filters and language constraints to ensure minimal and relevant data retrieval. Although it supresses the absence of continent area, further work could be done to sum up areas of countries within 
continents, to get a reasonable estimate. This does however mean that the query may become more complex and less efficient, as it would require the traversal of additional relationships and
the addition of more triple patterns. It would also require more time to investigate a path between continent and country.

\section{Country}
\subsection{Exploration}
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
SELECT DISTINCT 
    ?country
WHERE {
    ?country rdf:type dbo:Country. 
    ?country dcterms:subject dbc:Member_states_of_the_United_Nations. 
}
\end{verbatim}}


The goal of this query was to identify and retrieve country URIs in DBpedia and ensure alignment with those in Mondial. When retrieving all entities of the dbo:Country class, it was
found that it included relevant countries, but also defunct and unrecognised countries.

A suitable approach to remove incorrect countries was to find countries which are members of the UN. This would ensure that defunct or unrecognised countries
would not be retrieved. A limitation of this however, was that in Mondial overseas territories (e.g. RÃ©union) and administrative regions (e.g. Hong Kong) of countries are classed as
a separate country. Due to time constraints retrieving countries based on UN membership was the most viable option.

\subsection{Retrieval}
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
SELECT DISTINCT 
    ?Name
    COALESCE(STR(?isoCode), ?Name) AS ?Code
    (SAMPLE(?capitalCity) AS ?Capital)
    (SAMPLE(?ProvinceValue) AS ?Province)
    (xsd:integer(COALESCE(?cPop, ?popEst, ?popCen)) AS ?Population)
    (xsd:integer(SAMPLE(?cArea) / 1000) AS ?Area)
WHERE {
    ?country rdf:type dbo:Country. 
    ?country dcterms:subject dbc:Member_states_of_the_United_Nations. 
    ?country rdfs:label ?countryN.
    OPTIONAL{?country dbo:iso31661Code ?isoCode.}
    FILTER(lang(?countryN) = "en")
    BIND(STR(?countryN) AS ?Name)
    FILTER(?Name != "Member states of the United Nations")
    OPTIONAL{?country dbo:populationTotal ?cPop}
    OPTIONAL{?country dbp:populationEstimate ?popEst}
    OPTIONAL{?country dbp:populationCensus ?popCen}
    OPTIONAL{?country dbo:area ?cArea}
    {
        ?country dbo:capital ?capitalC.
    } UNION {
        ?country dbp:capital ?capitalC.
    }
    ?capitalC rdfs:label ?capitalCN. 
    FILTER(lang(?capitalCN) = "en")
    BIND(STR(?capitalCN) AS ?capitalCity)
    OPTIONAL{ 
        ?capitalC dbo:subdivision ?capitalSubdivisionEntity.
        ?capitalSubdivisionEntity rdfs:label ?capitalSubdivisionN.
        FILTER(lang(?capitalSubdivisionN) = "en")
        BIND(STR(?capitalSubdivisionN) AS ?capitalSubdivision)}
    BIND(COALESCE(?capitalSubdivision, ?Name) AS ?ProvinceValue)
}
GROUP BY ?Name ?isoCode ?cPop ?popEst ?popCen
\end{verbatim}}

The retrieval query builds on the exploratory query to extract key country attributes relevant to the Mondial database: Name, code, capital,
province of the capital, population, and area. 
\\ \\
To account for graph database inconsistencies, the query handles cases where certain properties are missing. For instance, while dbo:capital is used
to identify the capital city for many countries, some rely on dbp:capital (e.g. Denmark), so a union is applied to retrieve capital names
consistently. Similarly, ISO codes (?isoCode) are not available for all countries; in such cases, the country name is used as a fallback to
maintain data completeness. Area values are also not consistently identifiable, and the query accounts for their absence without omitting the
corresponding countries.
\\ \\
Population data was also missing for some countries, in such instances, estimates and census data were used. These various predicates were
used to retrieve potential population values and coalesced to minimise missing data. Some predicates also had multiple values for population,
so aggregation and sampling were used to prevent multiple rows of the same country. 
\\ \\
By grouping data and using functions like SAMPLE, the query efficiently handles duplicates and inconsistencies. The query is effective to an extent
where it uses various candidate values for missing populations and country codes. However from a scalability perspective, the inclusion of multiple
OPTIONAL clauses and unions introduces complexity, potentially increasing execution time as the number of triples grows. 

\section{City}

\subsection{Exploration}
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?country ?city
WHERE {
    ?country rdf:type dbo:Country;
        dcterms:subject dbc:Member_states_of_the_United_Nations.
    ?city rdf:type dbo:City;
        dbo:country ?country.
}
\end{verbatim}}

The goal of this query was to identify city entities in DBpedia and establish their association with countries, and ensuring relevance to the Mondial
database. By limiting countries to UN member countries, the query excludes cities located in defunct or unrecognised countries. Each city is
linked to a country through the dbo:country predicate, ensuring proper hierarchical alignment.
\\ \\
A limitation of this approach is that cities in overseas territories (e.g. RÃ©union) or administrative regions (e.g. Hong Kong) are omitted,
potentially leading to incomplete coverage. Additionally, variations in how DBpedia classifies cities and their hierarchical relations
with countries may introduce inconsistencies with how the Mondial database defines cities. However, this approach provides a robust starting point
for retrieving cities relevant to the Mondial database while maintaining efficiency by focusing only on recognised UN member countries.

\subsection{Retrieval}
{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}
PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
SELECT DISTINCT ?Name ?Country SAMPLE(?ProvinceValue) AS ?Province
?Population SAMPLE(?Lat) AS ?Latitude
SAMPLE(?Long) AS ?Longitude SAMPLE(?Elev) AS ?Elevation
WHERE {
    ?countryN rdf:type dbo:Country;
        dcterms:subject dbc:Member_states_of_the_United_Nations;
        rdfs:label ?countryLbl.
    OPTIONAL{?countryN dbo:iso31661Code ?isoCode.}
    ?cityN rdf:type dbo:City;
        dbo:country ?countryN;
        rdfs:label ?cityLbl.
    FILTER(lang(?countryLbl) = "en" && lang(?cityLbl) = "en")
    BIND(COALESCE(STR(?isoCode), STR(?countryLbl)) AS ?Country)
    BIND(STR(?cityLbl) AS ?Name)
    OPTIONAL{ 
        ?cityN dbo:subdivision ?subDiv.
        ?subDiv rdfs:label ?subDivLbl .
        FILTER(lang(?subDivLbl) = "en")
        BIND(STR(?subDivLbl) AS ?citySubDiv)}
    BIND(COALESCE(?citySubDiv, ?Country) AS ?ProvinceValue)
    OPTIONAL{?cityN geo:lat ?Lat}
    OPTIONAL{?cityN geo:long ?Long}
    OPTIONAL{?cityN dbp:elevationM ?Elev}
    OPTIONAL{?cityN dbp:populationTotal ?Population}
}
GROUP BY ?Country ?Name ?Population
\end{verbatim}}

The retrieval query involved finding city name, country, province of the city, population, longitude, latitude and elevation.
\\ \\
The query builds on the exploration query, ensuring that cities are part of UN countries, ensuring that the countries column would not have
missing values. The query uses existing statements from previous concept queries to hande missing values. One notable feature of the query is
the use of SAMPLE for handling optional data, such as the province, latitude, longitude, elevation, and population. This ensures that the query
returns only one value per city for each attribute, even when multiple values exist in DBpedia.
\\ \\
The query is effective to an extent as it is able to retrieve known cities such as New York, Manchester, Paris, etc. and  can handle missing values
such as population, and geographical properties, some of which are also missing in Mondial. However, as with most concepts in DBpedia, the definition of cities
differs to that of Mondial. The predicate dbo:City includes a wider variety of urban settlements, ranging from larger muncipalities to smaller towns, which are
not necessarily considered cities in the Mondial database. Further investigation could have been carried out to identify patterns that filters out smaller
towns and settlements.
\\ \\
The inclusion of multiple optional statements can increase the complexity. As more optional relationships (e.g., subdivisions or population estimates) are
added, the query may take longer to execute, especially on larger datasets, since it needs to explore multiple potential connections for each city. This can
slow down performance if the dataset is large, as each city is being linked to multiple properties.
