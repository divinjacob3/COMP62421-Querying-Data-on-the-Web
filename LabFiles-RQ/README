This directory contains the files needed for the Relational Querying (RQ) lab.  Specifically, we have:

sqliterc: Some parameters for sqlite3
TestScript.sql: A script file that runs a query using sqlite3
TestOutput.log: A log file produced as a result of running TestScript.sql
ra.jar: The Java jar file for the RA Relational Algebra system. Note you will need to have Java installed to run this.
RA:Documentation.pdf: The documentation for the RA Relational Algebra system
TestQuery.ra: A file containing a relational algebra query
RaOutput.log:  A log file produced as a result of running TestQuery.ra
mondial.db: The Mondial database for sqlite3
mondial.properties: Information on the database to use, for ra
mondial-schema.sql: The Mondial database schema

Here is the unix command line to run sqlite3 on TestScript.sql, which will populate TestOutput.log.

sqlite3 -init sqliterc mondial.db < TestScript.sql

Here is the unix command line to run ra on TestQuery.ra, which populates RaOutput.log; of course this needs java to be installed.

java -jar ra.jar mondial.properties -i TestQuery.ra -o RaOutput.log
